# Saas-Task-Manager_Backend
A multi-tenant SaaS backend for managing tasks, teams, roles, deadlines, and activity logs with authentication, authorization, and scalable architecture.

A production-ready backend system for managing tasks in a multi-user environment with role-based access control and audit logging.

## 🚀 Features
- JWT Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based permissions (ADMIN, MANAGER, MEMBER)
- Task lifecycle management
- Ownership enforcement
- Activity logs (audit trail)
- Secure password hashing
- Pagination-ready APIs

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT
- bcrypt
- Helmet & CORS

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up → password hashed at schema level
2. User logs in → receives JWT
3. Token sent via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. Middleware verifies token and attaches user context
5. Role-based guards enforce permissions

## 👥 Roles & Permissions
| Role | Capabilities |
|----|-------------|
| ADMIN | Full access, delete tasks, view logs |
| MANAGER | Create & assign tasks |
| MEMBER | Update assigned tasks only |

## 📦 API Modules
- `/auth` – Signup & Login
- `/tasks` – Task management
- `/activities` – Audit logs (ADMIN only)
- `/health` – Health check

## ▶️ Run Locally
